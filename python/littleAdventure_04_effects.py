# little adventure game with different rooms
# you can walk between the rooms
# changes:
# each item "knows" it's own location. no more inventorys for rooms and player
# item can be carried by monster: location ist then a negative monster number
# player is a child class of monster
# STATUS: does not work
# TODO: 
# * ab sucesschance bei Effect weitermachen
# * game unn√∂tig machen?
